Clustering for Maps v2 for Android
==================================

This is a working example that serve as proof of concept of poi clustering in Android Maps v2. 

Getting started
---------------

Of course, you must have a working **Google Play Services library** setup in your project, and do all this working from a **MapFragment** or wherever you have your **GoogleMap** object.

You have all the files you need in the [src/in/nlopez/clustering](https://github.com/mrmans0n/android-maps-v2-clustering/tree/master/src/in/nlopez/clustering) directory of the example project. **Just drop them in your project, and you're good to go.**

The objects you want to display in the map **must implement the Clusterable interface**. That interface only needs one method, getPosition() that returns a LatLng object (latitude and longitude).

An example:
```java
public class MyPoi implements Clusterable {
	private String name;
	private LatLng position;

	public MyPoi(String name, LatLng position) {
		this.name = name;
		this.position = position;
	}

	public String getName() { return name; }

	@Override
	public LatLng getPosition() { return position; }
}
```

In the class you are using the GoogleMap object, you must instance the **Clusterer** object.

```java
	GoogleMap map;
	Clusterer clusterer;

	[â€¦]

	private void initClusterer() {
		clustered = new Clusterer(this, map);		
	}

```

The **Clusterer** will control your zoom and will reload the cluster markers when the zoom changes without your interaction.

Customizing your markers
------------------------

You can customize the marker's appearance, even if it's a cluster marker. You have **two listeners** that will be invoked when the markers are being generated by the **Clusterer** and will be able to provide the markers with the **MarkerOptions** data we want.
